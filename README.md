# Dictionary App

A simple web-based dictionary application that allows users to look up the definition, phonetics, and examples of a given word. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter a word in the search field and click the search button to retrieve information about the word from the [Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/).

- **Dynamic UI Update:** The application dynamically updates the user interface with the word's definition, phonetics, and example sentences.

- **Audio Pronunciation:** Users can click on the speaker icon to hear the pronunciation of the word.

## Getting Started

To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application uses asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from the Dictionary API.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dictionary-app.git
cd dictionary-app
```
## Usage

1. Enter a word in the search field.
2. Click the search button to fetch data from the API.
